# Basic Python 

This repository contains my Python learning journey, starting with basic concepts and practice problems, and gradually moving into intermediate and advanced topics. It covers:

-  Fundamentals of Python (syntax, variables, loops, functions, etc.)
-  Practice problems to strengthen problem-solving
-  Intermediate concepts (OOP, modules, file handling)
-  Advanced topics (data structures, algorithms, libraries)

##  Repository Structure
- basics/ → Core Python fundamentals  
- practice/ → Coding exercises and problems  
- intermediate/ → Object-Oriented Programming & more  
- advanced/ → Data structures, algorithms, and projects  

##  Future Plans
- Add more practice problems regularly  
- Work on small projects to apply concepts  
- Explore Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)

📌 This repo will be updated as I progress in my Python learning journey.
