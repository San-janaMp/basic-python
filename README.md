# Basic Python 🐍

This repository contains my Python learning journey, starting with basic concepts and practice problems, and gradually moving into intermediate and advanced topics. It covers:

- ✅ Fundamentals of Python (syntax, variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- ✅ Practice problems to strengthen problem-solving
- 🔹 Intermediate concepts (OOP, modules, file handling)
- 🔹 Advanced topics (data structures, algorithms, libraries)

## 📂 Repository Structure
- basics/ → Core Python fundamentals  
- practice/ → Coding exercises and problems  
- intermediate/ → Object-Oriented Programming & more  
- advanced/ → Data structures, algorithms, and projects  

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add more practice problems regularly  
- Work on small projects to apply concepts  
- Explore Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)

📌 This repo will be updated as I progress in my Python learning journey.
